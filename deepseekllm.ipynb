            "The meaning of life is one of the deepest and most enduring philosophical questions, and different people, cultures, and belief systems have proposed various answers. Here are some perspectives:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Existentialism** (e.g., Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus): Life has no inherent meaning—we must create our own purpose through choices and actions.  \n",
            "   - **Absurdism** (Camus): Life is inherently meaningless, but we must rebel against this absurdity by embracing passion and living fully.  \n",
            "   - **Stoicism**: Meaning comes from virtue, self-control, and alignment with nature/logic.  \n",
            "   - **Nihilism**: Life has no objective meaning, purpose, or value.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Religious/Spiritual Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Theistic religions** (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.): Meaning is tied to divine purpose, such as serving God, achieving enlightenment, or fulfilling dharma (moral duty).  \n",
            "   - **Buddhism**: Meaning arises from escaping suffering (dukkha) through enlightenment (nirvana) and compassion.  \n",
            "   - **Pantheism/Panentheism**: Meaning comes from unity with the universe or the divine.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Scientific Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Evolutionary biology**: Life's \"purpose\" is survival and reproduction.  \n",
            "   - **Cosmology**: From a vast, indifferent universe, meaning is a human construct.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Personal/Subjective Meaning**  \n",
            "   Many find purpose in:  \n",
            "   - Relationships and love  \n",
            "   - Creativity and self-expression  \n",
            "   - Knowledge and discovery  \n",
            "   - Helping others (altruism)  \n",
            "   - Pursuit of happiness or fulfillment  \n",
            "\n",
            "### **My Take (AI Perspective)**  \n",
            "As an AI, I don’t experience life, but I observe that humans often find meaning in connection, growth, and leaving a legacy. Ultimately, the answer may be to *define it for yourself*.  \n",
